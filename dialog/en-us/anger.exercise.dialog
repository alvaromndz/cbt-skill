Sometimes angry feelings can be a bit like a tornado.They spin you round and round and you feel out of control!
Luckily the tornado is inside us and it won't stay forever. 
Let's Imagine you have a bottle half filled with water. 
You can shake it and make a whirling tornado inside the bottle! But if we wait, the water stops spinning and becomes still again.
Now imagine the whirling water is your anger. 
Now just count to 10 and watch the water whirl around until it slowly calms down. 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ,10 
Did the tornado go away?
